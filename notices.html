By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense2\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.

The Program version of PERFORCE is comprised of a principal server program, p4d, \u003cbr\u003e\r\none instance of which runs on a server machine and manages access to the central repository, or \u003cbr\u003e\r\n\"depot,\" in the Server Installation; and a principal client program, p4, instances of which are \u003cbr\u003e\r\ninvoked locally on each host machine containing a Client Workspace. The Program also \u003cbr\u003e\r\nincludes all other modules for which a link to either a user manual or release notes is provided at \u003cbr\u003e\r\nany time on the \"Documentation\" page of Perforce\u0027s web site (http://www.perforce.com/ \u003cbr\u003e\r\nperforce/technical.html). Other utility, administration and demonstration programs may be \u003cbr\u003e\r\nincluded as well. \u003cbr\u003e\r\nTypically each user will have his/her own dedicated client installation, which contains copies of \u003cbr\u003e\r\nfiles from the repository at particular revisions. The server comprises a request handler, a data \u003cbr\u003e\r\nmanager and a file librarian. The data manager implements database services and maintains a \u003cbr\u003e\r\ncontrol meta-database describing the status and history of versioned files in the depot and \u003cbr\u003e\r\ntransactions against the depot. The librarian implements an archive of versioned files. The \u003cbr\u003e\r\nrequest handler acts as an executive, sequencing actions and managing communication with the \u003cbr\u003e\r\nclient. \u003cbr\u003e\r\nPERFORCE provides a transactional change model based on atomic submissions of multiple \u003cbr\u003e\r\nfiles as one transactional \"change.\" PERFORCE provides a mechanism for selectively \u003cbr\u003e\r\nmaintaining synchronization of client work areas with the server so that client installations can \u003cbr\u003e\r\nbe reliably brought up to date. Once fetched, client files are localized on the client. \u003cbr\u003e\r\nPERFORCE supports parallel development (branching) and integration and reconciliation of \u003cbr\u003e\r\nparallel changes. PERFORCE provides for reporting from the depot on the status of clients, file \u003cbr\u003e\r\nchange histories, and work in progress. \u003cbr\u003e\r\nPerforce End User License Agreement Page 8 \u003cbr\u003e\r\nAttachment A \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAttachment B: Terms and Conditions of Support \u003cbr\u003e\r\n1.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. \u003ca name\u003d\"openSourceOriginalCodeRestrictionLicense2\"\u003eYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\u003c/a\u003e.

We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003col start\u003d\"0\" style\u003d\"margin-left: -14\"\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
